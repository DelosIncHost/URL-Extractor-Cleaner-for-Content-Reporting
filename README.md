This Script is tailored to streamline the process of extracting and cleaning URLs from a selected block of text within Google Docs. It is especially useful for handling content such as search engine results pages. The script automatically removes hyperlink titles, extracts the URLs, and removes any accompanying descriptions or non-URL text. The result is a clean list of clickable URLs, making it easier to integrate into reporting tools, for identifying and submitting unexpected, offensive, or harmful material and/or DMCA violation.

This script is ideal for teams responsible for monitoring and reporting offensive or harmful content, particularly from search engine results. Users can highlight an entire search engine results page within Google Docs, and the script will automatically extract the URLs, strip away any unnecessary titles or descriptions, and present a clean list of clickable URLs. This ensures that only relevant links are submitted for review, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of content reporting.
